            <h3>Movie review</h3>
                <p>"Lots of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the personalityes of
                    the players rther than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened. Even that would not have been so bad but 
                    the movie tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just tring to do the right thing."</p><br>
                <p>"I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this large group of captialist pigs could royally screw their
                    families, descendance, neighbor, countrymen and the rest of the world with absolutely no compassion."</p><br>
